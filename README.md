## Xero Coding Exercise by Jamie Clark
This repository contains a simple automated test to add a bank account to a Xero account as specified in the Xero coding
 exercise.

It is written in Java using the Selenium framework with Cucumber.

### How to run
This automated suite requires three tools to be present on the user's system to function correctly:
1. [Java 1.8 SDK](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) (or later).
2. [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/).
3. [Google Chromedriver](http://chromedriver.chromium.org/).

**Note:** These tools must be installed and the location of their executables added to the system path, instructions for 
[Windows](https://www.howtogeek.com/118594/how-to-edit-your-system-path-for-easy-command-line-access/)
and
[Mac](https://medium.com/@imstudio/path-macos-best-practice-for-path-environment-variables-on-mac-os-35ec4076a486)
.

To execute the test:
1. Clone or download this repository to an easily accessible location on your local machine.
2. Open a command line terminal (CMD on Windows, Terminal on Mac or Linux).
3. Navigate to the repository root folder _xero_challenge_ 
4. Execute `mvn test`

If there are any failures or issues running the test, please feel free to open an issue here in the Github project, 
and/or email me at [j.clark.nzl@gmail.com](mailto:j.clark.nzl@gmail.com).

I hope you have a **#beautiful** day!
